## Introduction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines. It's a classic binary classification problem, often used for underwater target detection. The model uses a dataset of sonar readings and employs various techniques to differentiate between rocks and mines.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found [here](kaggle.com). It consists of sonar signals, each labeled as 'R' (rock) or 'M' (mine). 

## Usage

To run the classification model and make predictions, follow the instructions that is specified in python file . It covers loading the model, preprocessing input data, and interpreting the predictions.

## Model

The classification model is built using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/). 

## Training

For those interested in training the model from scratch or retraining it with new data, refer to the [Training](training.md) guide. It includes information on data splitting, training settings, and model evaluation.

## Evaluation

This section provides insights into the model's performance, including metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. Visualizations and analysis of the results are also included.

## Results

In this  section, you can find the project's key findings, such as the model's accuracy, any notable challenges encountered, and potential areas for improvement.
